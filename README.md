## Day 1 🐼 — Pandas Kickoff

Started the journey by diving into **Pandas** — creating Series, DataFrames, doing basic indexing, filtering, grouping, and exploring real datasets.

> Baby steps with big tools — slow and steady wins the ETL race. 🐢

## Day 2 🔍 — ETL & Debug Drama

We (me and ChatGPT) spent way too long wondering why files weren’t showing up — only to realize the **Explorer sidebar section for folders was hidden under the RStudio tab** 🤯. Dragged it up, and voilà — all files were right there.

Also: struggled a bit with installing `pandas-profiling`, handling missing `pip`, and fixing terminal paths — **but we figured it out!**

> Lesson learned: **Always check your UI before blaming your code.** 😄

## Goals

- 🧹 Master ETL processes using Python and Pandas  
- 📊 Use profiling tools like `pandas-profiling` to explore data  
- 🧠 Learn from hands-on issues and document everything along the way
