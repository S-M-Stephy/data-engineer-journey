# Data Engineer Journey (Phase 1) 🛤️

This repo captured my first attempt at learning data engineering — the honest, messy, real beginning.

## 🌱 What I Did

- Practiced Python & SQL daily
- Built small ETL pipelines
- Used GitHub for version control
- Explored tools like Pandas Profiling, Jupyter, and VS Code
- Started a side project (Student Performance Tracker)

## Day 1 🐼 — Pandas Kickoff

Started the journey by diving into **Pandas** — creating Series, DataFrames, doing basic indexing, filtering, grouping, and exploring real datasets.

> Baby steps with big tools — slow and steady wins the ETL race. 🐢

## Day 2 🔍 — ETL & Debug Drama

We (me and ChatGPT) spent way too long wondering why files weren’t showing up — only to realize the **Explorer sidebar section for folders was hidden under the RStudio tab** 🤯. Dragged it up, and voilà — all files were right there.

Also: struggled a bit with installing `pandas-profiling`, handling missing `pip`, and fixing terminal paths — **but we figured it out!**

> Lesson learned: **Always check your UI before blaming your code.** 😄

## Day 3 📅 — CSV to SQLite ETL

- 🗂️ Created a `books.csv` file with sample data
- 📥 Extracted it using `pandas.read_csv`
- 🧹 Transformed the column names for SQL-friendliness
- 🧱 Loaded it into a local `books.db` using `sqlite3`
- 🔍 Queried the DB using Python (and Copilot!)

This was my first full ETL cycle — and I now understand how raw data turns into something queryable 💪

## Day 4 📅 — Movie Ratings Mini SQL Project 🎬

- Started a small real-world project with two CSV files: `movies.csv` and `ratings.csv`
- Loaded both into a SQLite database using pandas
- Wrote my **first fully self-written SQL query** to analyze the data — and it worked! 🥳

### ✅ What I Learned
- How to design simple relational data (movies + ratings)
- Writing SQL joins from scratch
- Real confidence boost — starting to feel like a data engineer!

> Slower day, but proud of the one query I wrote myself 😄

## 📅 Day 5 – Nashville Dataset Begins (Before the Break)

This was my last recorded activity before I paused the journey.

- ✅ Loaded the **Nashville Housing dataset**
- ✅ Generated a data profile using `ydata-profiling`
- ⏳ Data cleaning and transformation pending

At the time, I was just getting started with real-world messy data. I didn’t complete this task, and shortly after, I stopped learning for a while.

> I’m back now — with a better mindset, better tools, and stronger intent. This journey continues in my new repo.

## Goals 🎯

- 🔄 Master real-world ETL pipelines using Python and Pandas  
- 🗃️ Load and manage data using relational databases like SQLite and PostgreSQL  
- 📊 Explore and profile datasets with tools like `pandas-profiling` and `ydata-profiling`  
- 🧠 Strengthen SQL skills (DDL, DML, Joins, Aggregations, Subqueries, and Window functions)  
- 🧰 Build and automate workflows using tools like Airflow  
- 🛢️ Understand data warehousing concepts and work with cloud platforms  
- 🧪 Test, debug, and optimize pipelines like a real data engineer  
- 📝 Document everything along the way to build a public portfolio
- 💼 Become confident and job-ready for a backend or data engineering role

## 🛑 Why I Paused

After a few days, I hit a wall.  
I lost motivation, got distracted, and struggled to learn on my own. It happens.  
I don’t regret this — because this attempt taught me **how much I care** and what wasn’t working.

## 🔁 What’s Next

I'm starting fresh with a course-based roadmap and renewed energy.  
This repo stays here as a **reminder that beginnings matter**, even if they’re imperfect.

## 📦 Archived Status

This repository is no longer actively updated.  
New work is happening in my [Data Engineering Bootcamp](#) repo (coming soon!).
