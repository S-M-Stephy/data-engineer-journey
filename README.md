# 🚀 Data Engineer Journey

Welcome to my personal learning journey toward becoming a Data Engineer from scratch!  
This repository is a timeline of everything I’ve tried — from independent learning to guided projects.

---

## 📌 About This Repository

This repo is divided into **phases**, to reflect how my learning evolved.

### 🔹 Phase I – Self Learning (🛑 Closed)

My earliest hands-on work using Python, Pandas, profiling tools, and some beginner ETL tasks.  

📁 You’ll find it in:
`/Phase I - Self learning`

> ⚠️ **Note:** This phase is now closed.  
> It was a personal exploration with many half-done and trial tasks.  
> It’s not meant to teach or guide others — but I’m keeping it here to track how far I’ve come. 😊

## 🚧 Phase II – Guided Learning (Coming Soon)

This phase follows [Darshil’s Data Engineering Bootcamp] — a structured course I’ve enrolled in.  
I'll update this repo with learnings, notes, and projects **daily**.

## 🌱 Why This Repo Exists

I made this repo for one reason: **to show up for myself**.  
I lost momentum once — but I’m back stronger, more focused, and with the right resources.

> Whether or not someone else finds this useful —  
> This space is **proof that I didn’t give up**.
