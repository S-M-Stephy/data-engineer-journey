## Day 1 🐼 — Pandas Kickoff

Started the journey by diving into **Pandas** — creating Series, DataFrames, doing basic indexing, filtering, grouping, and exploring real datasets.

> Baby steps with big tools — slow and steady wins the ETL race. 🐢

## Day 2 🔍 — ETL & Debug Drama

We (me and ChatGPT) spent way too long wondering why files weren’t showing up — only to realize the **Explorer sidebar section for folders was hidden under the RStudio tab** 🤯. Dragged it up, and voilà — all files were right there.

Also: struggled a bit with installing `pandas-profiling`, handling missing `pip`, and fixing terminal paths — **but we figured it out!**

> Lesson learned: **Always check your UI before blaming your code.** 😄

## Day 3 📅 — CSV to SQLite ETL

- 🗂️ Created a `books.csv` file with sample data
- 📥 Extracted it using `pandas.read_csv`
- 🧹 Transformed the column names for SQL-friendliness
- 🧱 Loaded it into a local `books.db` using `sqlite3`
- 🔍 Queried the DB using Python (and Copilot!)

This was my first full ETL cycle — and I now understand how raw data turns into something queryable 💪

## Goals 🎯

- 🔄 Master real-world ETL pipelines using Python and Pandas  
- 🗃️ Load and manage data using relational databases like SQLite and PostgreSQL  
- 📊 Explore and profile datasets with tools like `pandas-profiling` and `ydata-profiling`  
- 🧠 Strengthen SQL skills (DDL, DML, Joins, Aggregations, Subqueries, and Window functions)  
- 🧰 Build and automate workflows using tools like Airflow  
- 🛢️ Understand data warehousing concepts and work with cloud platforms  
- 🧪 Test, debug, and optimize pipelines like a real data engineer  
- 📝 Document everything along the way to build a public portfolio
- 💼 Become confident and job-ready for a backend or data engineering role
