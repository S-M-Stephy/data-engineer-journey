# 🚀 Data Engineer Journey

Welcome to my personal learning journey toward becoming a Data Engineer from scratch!  
This repository is a timeline of everything I’ve tried — from independent learning to guided projects.

## 📌 About This Repository

This repo is organized into **phases**, reflecting how my learning evolved over time.

### 🔹 Phase I – Self Learning (🛑 Closed)

My earliest hands-on practice with Python, Pandas, profiling tools, and basic ETL tasks.

📁 You’ll find it in:  
`/Phase I - Self Learning`

> **Note:** This phase is now closed.  
> It was a personal exploration with many half-done and trial tasks.  
> It’s not meant to teach or guide others — but I’m keeping it here to track how far I’ve come. 😊

### 🟢 Phase II – Guided Learning (🎯 Ongoing)

This phase follows **Darshil’s Data Engineering Bootcamp** — a structured, project-based course.

📁 You’ll find it in:  
`/Phase II - Bootcamp`

I’m currently focused on:
- Python & SQL mastery (target: within 2–3 weeks)
- Building real-world data pipelines and systems
- Applying concepts with hands-on projects
- Logging key learnings and insights (not detailed notes)

> ⚡ This time, I’m moving with clarity, structure, and purpose.

I created this repo for one reason: **to show up for myself**.  
I lost momentum once — but I’m back, focused, and growing every single day.

> This space is proof that I didn’t give up. 🙌
